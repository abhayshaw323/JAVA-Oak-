 Definition:
    OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on 
the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior.
 • Key Principles:

  Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that 
operate on the data into a single unit (class).

  Inheritance: Ability to create new classes based on existing classes, 
inheriting attributes and behaviors.

  Polymorphism: Ability to treat objects of different classes through a 
common interface, typically using method overriding or overloading.

  Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the 
necessary features of an object.

Benefits:
   Modularity(divde the code into sub-code by logical way), reusability, ease of maintenance, and improved problem 
modeling.

Classes:
Blueprint for creating objects.
Contains attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that define 
the object's behavior.

Objects:
 Instances of a class created at runtime.

Constructors:
 Special methods that initialize new objects.

Access Modifiers:
    public, private, protected – control access to class members.

Static vs. Instance Members:
    Static members: Belong to the class; shared across all instances.
    Instance members: Unique to each object instance.
