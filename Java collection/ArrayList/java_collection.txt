Defintion :-
    Collection are data structure that group multiple elements into a single unit.
    The java Collection framework(in java.util) provides standard interface(list,set,Map) and their implementation.

Advantage over arrays:
    Dynamic Sizing : Automatically adjust to the number of elements.
    Rich API : Methods for adding,Searching,sorting etc.
    Type Safety : Use of generics minimizes runtime type errors.
    Utility Methods : Built-in support for common algorithms(e.g., sorting).

Use cases :
    Managing dynamic user inputs(Shopping carts,to-do lists).
    Data-driven application with frequently changing data sets.
What is ArrayList?
    Addition : add(element) and add(index,element).
    Access : get(index).
    Update : set(index,element).
    Removal : remove(index) or remove(object).
    Other Methods : size(),contains(element),clear(),indexOf(element).
Features:
    Random access with index lookup.
    ideal for dynamic,frequently modified data.
