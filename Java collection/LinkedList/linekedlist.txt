definition: A linked list is a doubly-linked list implementation of the list and deque interface in java.

Advantage :- 
    Efficient insertion and deletion at the begining or end.
    useful when frequent modification occur.

disadvantage :- 
    slower random access compared to ArrayList.

Common Methods:
    add(),addFirst,addLast()
    remove(),removeFirst(),removeLast()
    get(),getFirst(),getLast(),set()
    size(),contains(),clear()

key Point :- Linked list is optional for scenarios that require many insertion and deletion.

SORTING BASICS:
    Sorting arranges element in a specified order(natural Or custom).
    Natural order for number is ascending:forString,lexicographical.
        lexicographical means : where soting is done in alphabetical order.(ordering on the basis of ASCII Value).
USING COLLECTION.sort();
    collection.sort(list) sort a list in natural order.
Custom Sorting:
    Provide a comparator for custom order(e.g.,descending order).
    Lamda a expression can be used for concise custom comparator.
Consideration:
    Sorting an ArrayList is generally fast using merge sort.
    For linkedList,sorting is less Efficient due to sequential access.
Key point:
    List sorting is essential for data organization;java provides built-in methods for both natural and custom ordering.

Linked List:
    use for efficient insertion and deletion;not ideal for random access.
    Commmon operations:add,addFirst,addLast,remove,get,set,and iteration.
List sorting:
    Natural ordering via Collection.sort().
    Custom ordering requires a Comparator or lamda expression.
Best Practices:
    Use Generics to ensure type safety.
    For custom objects,define a clear Comparator based on key attributes.
    Test edge cases(e.g.,empty lists,null values) when sorting.
    Choose the appropriate collection type based on your access and modification needs.
